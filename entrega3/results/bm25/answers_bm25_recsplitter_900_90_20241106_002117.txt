Thus, detecting anti-Rh antibodies was difficult until anti-human immunoglobulin antibodies were developed. With these, maternal IgG antibodies bound to the fetal red blood cells can be detected after washing the cells to remove unbound immunoglobulin that is present in the fetal serum.

HDL-4, the most common condition in this group, is caused by expansion of trinucleotide repeats in TBP, the gene that encodes the TATA box binding protein involved in regulating transcription; this condition is identical to spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 17 (Chap. 451e), and most patients present primarily with ataxia rather than chorea. Mutations of the C9Orf gene associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have also been reported in some individuals with an HDL phenotype.\n\nThis is a rare familial disorder, described mostly in Japan and in small European pockets, in which symptoms of cerebellar ataxia are coupled with those of choreoathetosis and dystonia and, in some instances, parkinsonism, myoclonus, epilepsy, or dementia. Pathologically there is degeneration of the dentatorubral and pallidoluysian systems. The main consideration when chorea is a prominent feature is the separation of this disorder from Huntington disease. The gene defect in DRPLA is an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat in ATN1, which codes for the protein atrophin 1. This same mutation has been defined in affected families from throughout the world (e.g., Warner et al).

Most patients develop pes cavus and kyphoscoliosis, and there is a high incidence of cardiac disease and diabetes. The disease usually is caused by a GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in the gene encoding frataxin, a protein that regulates cellular iron levels, particularly in the mitochondria. The repeat expansion results in decreased protein levels through transcriptional silencing; decreased frataxin leads to mitochondrial dysfunction as well as increased oxidative damage.\n\nFragile X premutation syndrome of adults\u2002As discussed in Chap. 5, a curious form of progressive adult onset ataxia and tremor, previously thought to be of a degenerative type, has been discovered to be caused by a \u201cpremutation\u201d of the fragile X gene (50 to 200 trinucleotide repeats). Some of these patients have characteristic symmetrical MRI signal changes in the middle cerebellar peduncles in the T2 sequence.

The barrier is created largely by the elaborate tight junctions between the endothelial cells, which form continuous-type capillaries. Studies with the TEM using electron-opaque tracers show complex tight junctions between the endothelial cells. Morphologically, these junctions more closely resemble epithelial tight junctions than tight junctions present between other endothelial cells. In addition, TEM studies reveal a close association of astrocytes and their end foot processes with the endothelial basal lamina (Fig. 12.32).

The two principal types of edema are vasogenic and cytotoxic. Vasogenic edema refers to the influx of fluid and solutes into the brain through an incompetent blood-brain barrier (BBB). In the normal cerebral vasculature, endothelial tight junctions associated with astrocytes create an impermeable barrier (the BBB), through which access into the brain interstitium is dependent upon specific transport mechanisms. The BBB may be compromised in ischemia, trauma, infection, and metabolic derangements. Vasogenic edema results from abnormal permeability of the BBB, and typically develops rapidly following injury. Cytotoxic edema results from cellular swelling, membrane breakdown, and ultimately cell death.

The true prevalence of cor pulmonale is difficult to ascertain. First, not all patients with chronic lung disease will develop cor pulmonale, which may be subclinical in compensated individuals. Second, our ability to diagnose pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale by routine physical examination and laboratory testing is relatively insensitive. However, advances in 2-D echo/Doppler imaging and biomarkers (BNP) can make it easier to identify cor pulmonale.\n\nOnce patients with chronic pulmonary or pulmonary vascular disease develop cor pulmonale, the prognosis worsens. Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic bronchitis are responsible for approximately 50% of the cases of cor pulmonale in North America (Chap. 314), any disease that affects the pulmonary vasculature (Chap. 304) or parenchyma can lead to cor pulmonale (Table 279-4). Primary pulmonary vascular disorders are relatively rare causes of cor pulmonale, but cor pulmonale is extremely common with these conditions, given the magnitude of pulmonary hypertension present.\n\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Symptoms The symptoms of chronic cor pulmonale generally are related to the underlying pulmonary disorder. Dyspnea, the most common symptom, is usually the result of the increased work of breathing secondary to changes in elastic recoil of the lung (fibrosing lung diseases), altered respiratory mechanics (e.g., overinflation with COPD), or inefficient ventilation (e.g., primary pulmonary vascular disease). Orthopnea and PND are rarely symptoms of isolated right HF and usually point toward concurrent left heart dysfunction. Rarely, these symptoms reflect increased work of breathing in the supine position resulting from compromised diaphragmatic excursion. Abdominal pain and ascites that occur with cor pulmonale are similar to the right HF that ensues in chronic HF. Lower-extremity edema may occur secondary to neurohormonal activation, elevated RV filling\n\nThe response of the RV to pulmonary hypertension depends on the acuteness and severity of the pressure overload. Acute cor pulmonale occurs after a sudden and severe stimulus (e.g., massive pulmonary embolus), with RV dilatation and failure but no RV hypertrophy (Chap. 300). Chronic cor pulmonale, however, is associated with a more slowly evolving and progressive pulmonary hypertension that leads to initial modest RV hypertrophy and subsequent RV dilation. Acute decompensation of previously compensated chronic cor pulmonale is a common clinical occurrence. Triggers include worsening hypoxia from any cause (e.g., pneumonia), acidemia (e.g., exacerbation of COPD), acute pulmonary embolus, atrial tachyarrhythmia, hypervolemia, and mechanical ventilation that leads to compressive forces on alveolar blood vessels."]]},"4": {"question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought in by his parents for recurrent abdominal pain.

However, cognitive behavioral therapy tends to take longer to be effective and is generally more expensive than antidepressant treatment. Psychotherapy is often combined with antidepressant treatment, and the combination appears more effective than either strategy alone.\n\nB. Anxiety Disorders\n\nAs to the levels that pose a danger to the child, there is still some uncertainty. Rutter, who reviewed all of the evidence up to 1980, concluded that persistent blood levels above 40 mcg/dL may cause slight cognitive impairment and, less certainly, an increased risk of behavioral difficulties. More recently, Canfield and colleagues reported, from a prospective study of 172 children, that even lower levels may induce a decline in IQ at 3 and 5 years of age. These data require confirmation before general acceptance. Further compounding the problem of interpreting low-level lead exposure in children with blood lead concentrations below 45 mcg/dL is the observation by Rogan and colleagues that treatment with succimer, while successful in reducing lead levels, did not improve cognitive or behavioral function.\n\nTreatment of suspected pelvic congestion ranges from the less invasive hormonal suppression and cognitive behavioral pain management to the more invasive ovarian vein embolization or hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (93\u201397). Low-estrogen, progestin-dominant continuous oral contraceptives, high-dose progestins, and GnRH analogues often provide pain relief (94). Hormonal suppression should be the initial mode of treatment for women with suspected pelvic congestion. Medroxyprogesterone acetate, 30 mg daily, is useful (95). A multidisciplinary approach incorporating psychotherapy, behavioral pain management, or both is highly recommended. Percutaneous transcatheter embolization can be considered for women who do not respond to medical or hormonal therapy (96,97).

In the most severe cases, large purpuric lesions develop (purpura fulminans). Some patients (including those with overwhelming sepsis) may have no rash. While petechial rash and fever are important signs of meningococcal disease, fewer than 10% of children (and, in some clinical settings, fewer than 1% of patients) with this presentation are found to have meningococcal disease.

Patients may have asymptomatic hypercalcemia or vague symptoms associated with hypercalcemia (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, constipation, malaise, or dyspepsia). Nephrolithiasis and osteitis fibrosa cystica (less commonly) may also occur. Biochemical investigations reveal hypercalcemia, usually in association with elevated circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) (Table 408-3). The hypercalcemia is usually mild, and severe hypercalcemia or parathyroid cancer is a rare occurrence. Additional differences in the primary hyperparathyroidism of patients with MEN 1, as opposed to those without MEN 1, include an earlier age at onset (20\u201325 years vs 55 years) and an equal male-to-female ratio (1:1 vs 1:3).

For both disorders, hypocalcemia seems to be the common denominator in initiating the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Primary (1\u00b0) and secondary (2\u00b0) hyperparathyroidism can be distinguished conceptually by the autonomous growth of the parathyroid glands in primary hyperparathyroidism (presumably irreversible) and the adaptive response of the parathyroids in secondary hyperparathyroidism (typically reversible).

MRI is able to demonstrate more subtle abnormalities, such as muscle and tendon tears of the rotator cuff or a labral tear of the joint capsule. In most patients the pain subsides gradually with immobilization and analgesics followed by a program of increasing shoulder mobilization. If it does not, the injection of small amounts of corticosteroids into the bursa, or the site of major pain indicated by passive shoulder movement in the case of rotator cuff injuries, is often temporarily effective and allows the patient to mobilize the shoulder.

The autosomal dominant form of polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common life-threatening monogenic disease, affecting 12 million people worldwide. The autosomal recessive form of polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is rarer but affects the pediatric population. Kidney cysts are often seen in a wide range of syndromic diseases. Recent studies have shown that defects in the structure or function of the primary cilia may underlie this group of genetic diseases collectively termed ciliopathies (Table 339-1).\n\nFIGuRE 339-1 Scheme of the primary cilium and cystic kidney disease proteins. Left. A scheme of the primary cilium. Primary cilia share a \u201c9+0\u201d organization of microtubule doublets.

Potential disease mechanisms due to cilium-mediated signaling events.\n\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited kidney disease, occurring in about 1 in 1000 people. Approximately 12.5 million people worldwide have ADPKD, which is caused primarily by mutations in PKD1 (85%\u201390% of cases) or PKD2 (\u224815% of cases). The major phenotype of ADPKD is enlargement of the kidneys due to the presence of hundreds or thousands of space-occupying renal cysts that can be as large as 20 cm in diameter. Cysts are also seen in the liver and other organs in this condition. About 50% of patients with ADPKD progress to renal failure by the age of 60. Although it is not clear how mutations in PKD1 and PKD2 cause ADPKD, renal cyst formation may result from defects in Ca++ uptake that alter Ca++-dependent signaling pathways, including those controlling kidney cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.\n\nFIGuRE 339-2 Photograph showing a kidney from a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.

The pathophysiology of anal fissure is thought to be related to trauma from either the passage of hard stool or prolonged diarrhea. A tear in the anoderm causes spasm of the internal anal sphincter, which results in pain, increased tearing, and decreased blood supply to the anoderm. This cycle of pain, spasm, and ischemia contributes to development of a poorly healing wound that becomes a chronic fissure. The vast major-ity of anal fissures occur in the posterior midline. Ten percent to 15% occur in the anterior midline. Less than 1% of fissures occur off midline.Symptoms and Findings.\u2002Anal fissure is extremely common.

Rectovaginal or anovaginal fistulas can develop after obstetric injury, operative complications during pelvic surgery, and in\ufb02ammatory bowel disease exacerbations. Fistulas cause fecal incontinence, and the degree of postoperative dysfunction depends on the location of the fistula and the amount of sphincter that is disrupted during the surgical repair.

Similar to sphincterotomy, rectal sensory innervation can be disrupted, and injury to the internal sphincter can occur during sharp dissection (68,69).\n\nColonic Sources of Bleeding Hemorrhoids are probably the most common cause of LGIB; anal fissures also cause minor bleeding and pain.

In most acute hepatocellular disorders, the ALT is higher than or equal to the AST. Whereas the AST:ALT ratio is typically <1 in patients with chronic viral hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a number of groups have noted that as cirrhosis develops, this ratio rises to >1. An AST:ALT ratio >2:1 is suggestive, whereas a ratio >3:1 is highly suggestive, of alcoholic liver disease. The AST in alcoholic liver disease is rarely >300 IU/L, and the ALT is often normal. A low level of ALT in the serum is due to an alcohol-induced deficiency of pyridoxal phosphate.\n\nPatients with alcoholic liver disease are often identified through routine screening tests. The typical laboratory abnormalities seen in fatty liver are nonspecific and include modest elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), often accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia and hyperbilirubinemia. In alcoholic hepatitis and in contrast to other causes of fatty liver, AST and ALT are usually elevated twoto sevenfold. They are rarely >400 IU, and the AST/ALT ratio is >1 (Table 363-2). Hyperbilirubinemia is accompanied by modest increases in the alkaline phosphatase level. Derangement in hepatocyte synthetic function indicates more serious disease. Hypoalbuminemia and coagulopathy are common in advanced liver injury. Ultrasonography is useful in detecting fatty infiltration of the liver and determining liver size.

Wilson\u2019s disease occurs primarily in young adults. Autoimmune hepatitis is typically seen in young to middle-aged women but may affect men and women of any age. Alcoholic hepatitis can be differentiated from viral and toxin-related hepatitis by the pattern of the aminotransferases: patients with alcoholic hepatitis typically have an AST-to-ALT ratio of at least 2:1, and the AST level rarely exceeds 300 U/L. Patients with acute viral hepatitis and toxin-related injury severe enough to produce jaundice typically have aminotransferase levels >500 U/L, with the ALT greater than or equal to the AST. While ALT and AST values <8 times normal may be seen in either hepatocellular or cholestatic liver\n\na.\n\nHepatic disease: Plasma AST and ALT are elevated in nearly all hepatic diseases but are particularly high in conditions that cause extensive cell necrosis, such as severe viral hepatitis, toxic injury, and prolonged circulatory collapse. ALT is more specific than AST for liver disease, but the latter is more sensitive because the liver contains larger amounts of AST.

These effects are mediated by receptors on osteoclasts and renal tubular cells. Calcitonin exerts additional effects through receptors present in the brain, the gastrointestinal tract, and the immune system. The hormone, for example, exerts analgesic effects directly on cells in the hypothalamus and related structures, possibly by interacting with receptors for related peptide hormones such as calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide (CGRP) or amylin. Both of these ligands have specific high-affinity receptors that share considerable structural similarity with the PTH1R and can also bind to and activate calcitonin receptors. The calcitonin receptor shares considerable structural similarity with the PTH1R.\n\n0.1\n\nFIGURE 29\u20133 Correlations between the therapeutic potency of antipsychotic drugs and their affinity for binding to dopamine D1 (top) or D2 receptors (bottom).

Within the gastrointestinal tract, activation of dopamine receptors inhibits cholinergic smooth muscle stimulation; blockade of this effect is believed to be the primary prokinetic mechanism of action of these agents. These agents increase esophageal peristaltic amplitude, increase lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and enhance gastric emptying but have no effect on small intestine or colonic motility. Metoclopramide and domperidone also block dopamine D2 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the medulla (area postrema), resulting in potent antinausea and antiemetic action.\n\n1.\n\nMany functions of the SNS are similar to those of the adrenal medulla, an endocrine gland. This functional similarity is partly explained by the developmental relationships between the cells of the adrenal medulla and postsynaptic sympathetic neurons. Both are derived from the neural crest, are innervated by presynaptic sympathetic neurons, and produce closely related physiologically active agents, EPI and NE. A major difference is that the sympathetic neurons deliver the agent directly to the effector, whereas the cells of the adrenal medulla deliver the agent indirectly through the bloodstream. The innervation of the adrenal medulla may constitute an exception to the rule that autonomic innervation consists of a two-neuron chain from the CNS to an effector unless the adrenal medullary cell is considered the functional equivalent of the second neuron (in effect, a neurosecretory"]]},"32": {"question": "A 27-year-old G1P0 presents to her obstetrician for her normal 30-week obstetric appointment.

These \"mirror image twins\" are genetically identical but have mirror image features such as handedness and hair whorls (Post, 2015).\n\nMore seriously, several aberrations in monozygotic twinning result in a spectrum of fetal malformations. hese are traditionally ascribed to incomplete splitting of an embryo into two separate twins. However, it is possible that they may result from early secondary fusion of two separate embryos. These separated embryos are either symmetrical or asymmetrical, and the spectrum of anomalies is shown in Figure 45-13.\n\nA. At 0 to 4 days postfertilization, an early conceptus may divide into two. Division at this early stage creates two chorions and two amnions (dichorionic, diamnionic). Placentas may be separate or fused. B. Division between 4 to 8 days leads to formation of a blastocyst with two separate embryoblasts (inner cell masses). Each embryoblast will form its own amnion within a shared chorion (monochorionic, diamnionic). C. Between 8 and 12 days, the amnion and amnionic cavity form above the germinal disc. Embryonic division leads to two embryos with a shared amnion and shared chorion (monochorionic, monoamnionic). D. Difering theories explain conjoined twin development. One describes an incomplete splitting of one embryo into two. The other describes fusion of a portion of one embryo from a monozygotic pair onto the other.\n\nThe outcome of the monozygotic twinning process depends on when division oCCuts. If zygotes divide within the irst 72 hours after fertilization, two embryos, two amnions, and two chorions develop, and a diamnionic, dichorionic twin pregnancy evolves (Fig. 45-1). Two distinct placentas or a single, fused placenta may develop. If division occurs between the fourth and eighth day, a diamnionic, monochorionic twin pregnancy results. By approximately 8 days after fertilization, the chorion and the amnion have already diferentiated, and division results in two embryos within a common amnionic sac, that is, a monoamnionic, monochorionic twin pregnancy. Conjoined twins result if twinning is initiated later.\n\nThe trachea divides into two branches forming the main (primary) bronchi. Anatomically, these divisions are more frequently described as simply the right and left main bronchi, terms that are more useful because of the physical difference between the two. The right bronchus is wider and significantly shorter than the left. On entering the hilum of the lung, each main bronchus divides into the lobar bronchi (secondary bronchi). The left lung is divided into two lobes; the right lung is divided into three lobes. Thus, the right bronchus divides into three lobar bronchial branches, and the left into two lobar bronchial branches, with each branch supplying one lobe. The left lung is further divided into 8 bronchopulmonary segments and the right lung into 10 such segments. Thus, in the right lung the lobar bronchi give rise to 10 segmental bronchi (tertiary bronchi); the lobar bronchi of the"]]},"33": {"question": "A 72-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with increasing fever and abdominal pain over the past week.

Office drainage of an uncomplicated anorectal abscess may suffice. A small incision close to the anal verge is made, and a Mallenkot drain is advanced into the abscess cavity. For patients who have a complicated abscess or who are diabetic or immunocompromised, drainage should be performed in an operating room under anesthesia. These patients are at greater risk for developing necrotizing fasciitis. There is limited role of antibiotics in management of anorectal abscesses. The antibiotics are only warranted in patients who are 1978 immunocompromised or have prosthetic heart valves, artificial joints, diabetes, or inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nStandard therapy for intra-abdominal abscess is evacuation and drainage combined with appropriate parenteral administration of antibiotics. Abscesses located low in the pelvis, particularly in the area of the vaginal cuff, can be reached through a vaginal approach. In many patients, the ability to drain an abscess by placement of a drain percutaneously under CT guidance obviated the need for surgical exploration. With CT guidance, a pigtail catheter is placed into an abscess cavity via transperineal, transrectal, or transvaginal approaches. The catheter is left in place until drainage decreases. Transperineal and transrectal drainage of deep pelvic abscesses is successful in 90% to 93% of patients, obviating the need for surgical management (99,100).\n\nCT and MRI are the most important diagnostic tools. In the CT scan, the capsule of the abscess enhances and the center of the abscess and surrounding edematous white matter are hypodense. With MRI, in T1-weighted images, the capsule enhances and the interior of the abscess is hypointense and shows restricted diffusion; in T2-weighted images, the surrounding edema is apparent and the capsule is hypointense and there is variable diffusion restriction within the lesion (see Fig. 31-2, right). The abscess capsule tends to be thinner on the side directed to the lateral ventricle. Cerebritis appears as dot-sized areas of decreased density that enhance with gadolinium.

Susan Gearhart contributed to this chapter in the 18th edition.\n\nMorbidity and mortality from acute intestinal obstruction have been decreasing over the past several decades. Nevertheless, the diagnosis can still be challenging, and the type of complications that patients suffer has not changed significantly. The extent of mechanical obstruction is typically described as partial, high-grade, or complete\u2014generally correlating with the risk of complications and the urgency with which the underlying disease process must be addressed. Obstruction is also commonly described as being either \u201csimple\u201d or, alternatively, \u201cstrangulated\u201d if vascular insufficiency and intestinal ischemia are evident.\n\ncomplications of pyloromyotomy include perforation of the mucosa (1\u20133%), bleeding, wound infection, and recur-rent symptoms due to inadequate myotomy. When perforation occurs, the mucosa is repaired with a stitch that is placed to tack the mucosa down and reapproximate the serosa in the region of the tear. A nasogastric tube is left in place for 24 hours. The outcome is generally very good.Intestinal Obstruction in the NewbornThe cardinal symptom of intestinal obstruction in the newborn  is bilious emesis. Prompt recognition and treatment of neonatal intestinal obstruction can truly be lifesaving.The incidence of neonatal intestinal obstruction is 1 in 2000 live births. The approach to intestinal obstruction in the newborn infant is critical for timely and appropriate interven-tion. When a neonate develops bilious vomiting, one must con-sider a surgical etiology. Indeed, the majority of\n\nIntestinal Obstruction Patients with epithelial ovarian cancer often develop intestinal obstruction, either at the time of initial diagnosis or in association with recurrent disease (325\u2013340). Obstruction may be related to a mechanical blockage or to carcinomatous ileus.\n\nThe intestinal blockage can be corrected in most patients whose obstruction appears at initial diagnosis. The decision to perform an exploratory procedure to ease intestinal obstruction in patients with recurrent disease is more difficult. For patients whose life expectancy is very short (e.g., less than 2 months), surgical relief of the obstruction is not indicated (325\u2013330). In those patients with a longer projected lifespan, features predicting a reasonable likelihood of correcting the obstruction include young age, good nutritional status, and the absence of rapidly accumulating ascites (326).\n\nThe manifestations of acute intestinal obstruction depend on the nature of the underlying disease process, its location, and changes in blood flow (Fig. 355-1). Increased intestinal contractility, which occurs proximally and distal to the obstruction, is a characteristic response. Subsequently, intestinal peristalsis slows as the intestine or stomach proximal to the point of obstruction dilates and fills with gastrointestinal secretions and swallowed air. Although swallowed air is the primary contributor to intestinal distension, intraluminal air may also accumulate from fermentation, local carbon dioxide production, and altered gaseous diffusion."]]},"36": {"question": "A 25-year-old woman has dysuria, pyuria, increased frequency of urination, and fever of 1-day duration.

Principally they include the caudate nucleus and the lentiform (lenticular, from its lens-like shape) nucleus with its two subdivisions\u2014the putamen and globus pallidus. Insofar as the caudate nucleus and putamen are really a continuous structure (separated only incompletely by fibers of the internal capsule) and are cytologically and functionally distinct from the pallidum, it is more meaningful to divide these nuclear masses into the striatum (or neostriatum), comprising the caudate nucleus and putamen, and the paleostriatum or pallidum, which has a medial (internal) and a lateral (external) portion. The putamen and pallidum lie on the lateral aspect of the internal capsule, which separates them from the caudate nucleus, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra on its medial side (Figs. 4-1 and 4-2). By\n\nMedial to the internal capsule is the caudate nucleus. The caudate nucleus is a large C-shaped structure divided into a head, body, and tail, which closely follows the shape of the lateral ventricle (eFig. 9.58). Rostrally, the head of the caudate has a large rounded shape that contributes to the lateral wall of the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle (eFig. 9.58). Also at this level, the head of the caudate is continuous with the putamen (eFig. 9.59). Because of this close relationship the putamen and caudate are referred to collectively as the striatum. At the level of the interventricular foramen, the head of the caudate transitions to the body. The body of the caudate is long and narrows substantially as it transitions from the head to the tail (eFig. 9.59). Along its course the body contributes to the floor of the lateral ventricle. Near the posterior border of the thalamus the\n\nGross atrophy bilaterally of the head of the caudate nucleus and putamen is the characteristic abnormality, usually accompanied by a moderate degree of gyral atrophy in the frontal and temporal regions. The caudate atrophy alters the configuration of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles in that the inferolateral borders do not show the usual bulge formed by the head of the caudate nucleus. In addition, the ventricles are diffusely enlarged (Fig. 38-4); in CT scans, the bicaudate-to-cranial ratio is increased, which corroborates the clinical diagnosis in the moderately advanced case.\n\nLacunes are situated, in descending order of frequency, in the putamen and caudate nuclei, thalamus, basis pontis, internal capsule, and deep in the central hemispheral white matter.

These drugs are contraindicated in pregnancy because they cause fetal kidney damage.\n\nPathophysiology of Ischemic Acute Renal Failure 1803\n\nVasoconstriction in response to: endothelin, adenosine, angiotensin II, thromboxane A2, leukotrienes, sympathetic nerve activity\n\nVasodilation in response to: nitric oxide, PGE2, acetylcholine,  bradykinin\n\nLeukocyte-endothelial adhesion, vascular obstruction, leukocyte activation, and inflammation\n\nCytoskeletal breakdown Loss of polarity Apoptosis and necrosis Desquamation of viable\n\nFIGuRE 334-4 Interacting microvascular and tubular events contributing to the pathophysiology of ischemic acute kidney injury.\n\nACE proteolytically inactivates the vasodilatory hormone bradykinin and converts angiotensin I, an inactive hormone, to angiotensin II, an active vasoconstrictive hormone. Thus ACE increases angiotensin II levels and decreases bradykinin levels. ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril, enalapril, and captopril) are used clinically to reduce systemic blood pressure in patients with hypertension by decreasing angiotensin II levels and elevating bradykinin levels. Both effects lower systemic vascular resistance, reduce blood pressure, and decrease renal vascular resistance, thereby increasing GFR and RBF. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (e.g., losartan) are also used to treat hypertension. As their name suggests, they block the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin II receptor (AT1). These antagonists block the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II on the afferent arteriole; thus\n\nFIguRE 18-2 Events leading to activation, sensitization, and spread of sensitization of primary afferent nociceptor terminals. A. Direct activation by intense pressure and consequent cell damage. Cell damage induces lower pH (H+) and leads to release of potassium (K+) and to synthesis of prostaglandins (PG) and bradykinin (BK). Prostaglandins increase the sensitivity of the terminal to bradykinin and other pain-producing substances. B. Secondary activation. Impulses generated in the stimulated terminal propagate not only to the spinal cord but also into other terminal branches where they induce the release of peptides, including substance P (SP). Substance P causes vasodilation and neurogenic edema with further accumulation of bradykinin (BK). Substance P also causes the release of histamine (H) from mast cells and serotonin (5HT) from platelets."]]},"43": {"question": "An anxious mother brings her daughter into the clinic on her 5th birthday.

These symptoms suggest an inflammatory or infectious process, possibly leading to a right shift in the hemoglobin dissociation curve.\n\nA right shift in the hemoglobin dissociation curve typically indicates a decrease in hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, allowing for more oxygen to be released to tissues.

An increase in CO2 production by tissue and its release into blood results in the generation of hydrogen ions (H+) and a decrease in pH. This shifts the dissociation curve to the right, which has a beneficial effect by aiding in the release of O2 from Hgb for diffusion into tissues. The shift to the right in the dissociation curve is due to the decrease in pH and to a direct effect of CO2 on Hgb. Conversely, as blood passes through the lungs, CO2 is exhaled, which results in an increase in pH, which in turn causes the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to shift to the left.

During exercise, the high concentration of CO2 and the formation of lactic acid cause a reduction in tissue pH. This decrease in pH, in addition to the increase in temperature in the contracting muscle, shifts the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the right (see ). Therefore, at any given PO2, less O2 is held by the hemoglobin in the red blood cells, and consequently more O2 is available for the tissues. Oxygen consumption may increase as much as 60-fold, with only a 15-fold increase in muscle blood flow. Muscle myoglobin may serve as a limited O2 store during exercise, and it can release the attached O2 at very low partial pressures. However, myoglobin can also facilitate O2 transport from capillaries to mitochondria by serving as an O2 carrier."]]},"46": {"question": "A 75-year-old Caucasian man presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain.

Glutamine, produced by the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids in muscle, is deaminated by glutaminase to ammonia + glutamate. The glutamate is deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase to ammonia + \u03b1ketoglutarate, which can be used for gluconeogenesis. Free amino acids are taken into enterocytes by several different sodium-linked transport systems. Healthy, well-fed individuals are in nitrogen balance, in which nitrogen input equals output. The liver converts ammonia to urea, and the kidneys use ammonia to buffer protons. Amino acid catabolism begins with transamination that generates glutamate. The glutamate undergoes oxidative deamination. Toxic ammonia is transported as glutamine and alanine. Arginine is synthesized and hydrolyzed in the hepatic urea cycle.\n\nFor Questions 19.3\u201319.5, use the following scenario.\n\nTwo mechanisms are available in humans for the transport of ammonia from peripheral tissues to the liver for conversion to urea. Both are important in, but not exclusive to, skeletal muscle. The first uses glutamine synthetase to combine ammonia with glutamate to form glutamine, a nontoxic transport form of ammonia (Fig. 19.13). The glutamine is transported in the blood to the liver where it is cleaved by glutaminase to glutamate and ammonia (see p. 256). The glutamate is oxidatively deaminated to ammonia and \u03b1-ketoglutarate by GDH. The ammonia is converted to urea. The second transport mechanism involves the formation of alanine by the transamination of pyruvate produced from both aerobic glycolysis and metabolism of the succinyl coenzyme A (CoA) generated by the catabolism of the BCAA isoleucine and valine. Alanine is transported in the blood to the liver, where it is transaminated by\n\n2.\n\nGlutamine: This amide of glutamate provides a nontoxic storage and transport form of ammonia (Fig. 19.18). The ATP-requiring formation of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia by glutamine synthetase occurs primarily in skeletal muscle and the liver but is also important in the CNS, where it is the major mechanism for the removal of ammonia in the brain. Glutamine is found in plasma at concentrations higher than other amino acids, a finding consistent with its transport function. [Note: The liver keeps blood ammonia levels low through glutaminase, GDH, and the urea cycle in periportal (close to inflow of blood) hepatocytes and through glutamine synthetase as an ammonia scavenger in the perivenous hepatocytes.] Ammonia metabolism is summarized in Figure 19.19.\n\nC. Hyperammonemia\n\nConfirmatory testing for OTC includes a plasma amino acid profile, which may show reduced citrulline and arginine concentrations with increased glutamate and alanine. A urine organic acid profile shows increased excretion of orotic acid after protein loading or with concurrent administration of allopurinol. Mutation testing, deletion testing, and sequencing of the entire coding region of the related genes are available as clinical tests.\n\nArgininosuccinate lyase (ASL) deficiency is autosomal recessive, and most children in the United States are detected as a result of an elevated citrulline on newborn screening. The diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of elevated argininosuccinic acid in the urine.\n\nTreatment of Hyperammonemia"]]},"49": {"question": "A 48-year-old woman presents to the emergency room because of severe back pain after a fall.

The pain is usually described as primarily abdominal or pelvic, accompanied by back pain and usually unaffected by posture. The patient may occasionally complain of back pain only.\n\nPain of spine origin may be located in the back or referred to the buttocks or legs. Diseases affecting the upper lumbar spine tend to refer pain to the lumbar region, groin, or anterior thighs. Diseases affecting the lower lumbar spine tend to produce pain referred to the buttocks, posterior thighs, calves, or feet. Referred pain can explain pain syndromes that cross multiple dermatomes without evidence of nerve root compression.\n\nDespite our current ignorance of how most common genetic variants predispose to (or protect from) autoimmune disorders, several other approaches have begun to shed light on the genetic mechanisms of disease. These include the study of mutations that cause overt alterations in molecules regulating tolerance or the innate immune system; the study of patients with rare, monogenic defects of immune tolerance; and investigations into how certain HLA alleles predispose to disease by their ability to present certain self antigens. We will briefly explore each of these in the following sections.\n\n15-20 Many genes that predispose to autoimmunity fall into categories that affect one or more tolerance mechanisms.\n\nThe failure to consider other potential structures that may produce back pain can lead to significant mortality and morbidity. Pain may refer to the back from a number of organs situated in the retroperitoneum. Pancreatic pain in particular refers to the back and may be associated with pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis. Renal pain, which may be produced by stones in the renal collecting system or renal tumors, also typically refers to the back. More often than not this is usually unilateral; however, it can produce central posterior back pain. Enlarged lymph nodes in the preand para-aortic region may produce central posterior back pain and may be a sign of solid tumor malignancy, infection, or Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.
