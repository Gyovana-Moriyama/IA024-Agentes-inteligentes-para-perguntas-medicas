Glutamine is imported into the glutamatergic neuron (A) and converted into glutamate by glutaminase. The glutamate is then concentrated in vesicles by the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT).

She says that she was walking home from work when she slipped on a patch of ice on the sidewalk. Since she did not have anything to hold onto, she fell backwards and landed on her posterior iliac crests bilaterally. Immediately after the fall, she started experiencing back pain and tenderness that concerned her enough to call for an ambulance. Her past medical history is significant for arthritis, diabetes, and hypertension. On arrival, her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 129/86 mmHg, pulse is 112/min, respirations are 19/min.

Randomized trial evidence suggests that bed rest is ineffective for treating sciatica as well as back pain alone. Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are useful for pain relief, although severe pain may require short courses of opioid analgesics.\n\nThe mechanism of action of 5-ASA is not certain. The primary action of salicylate and other NSAIDs is due to blockade of prostaglandin synthesis by inhibition of cyclooxygenase. However, the aminosalicylates have variable effects on prostaglandin production. It is thought that 5-ASA modulates inflammatory mediators derived from both the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. Other potential mechanisms of action of the 5-ASA drugs relate to their ability to interfere with the production of\n\nFor patients with neck pain unassociated with trauma, supervised exercise with or without mobilization appears to be effective.
