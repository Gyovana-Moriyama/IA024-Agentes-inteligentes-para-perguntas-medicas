The pathophysiology of anal fissure is thought to be related to trauma from either the passage of hard stool or prolonged diarrhea. A tear in the anoderm causes spasm of the internal anal sphincter, which results in pain, increased tearing, and decreased blood supply to the anoderm. This cycle of pain, spasm, and ischemia contributes to development of a\n\ntag and/or a hypertrophied anal papilla internally. These fissures are more challenging to treat and may require surgery. A lateral loca-tion of a chronic anal fissure may be evidence of an underlying disease such as Crohn\u2019s disease, HIV, syphilis, tuberculosis, or leukemia. If the diagnosis is in doubt or there is suspicion of another cause for the perianal pain such as abscess or fistula, an examination under anesthesia may be necessary.Treatment.\u2002Therapy focuses on breaking the cycle of pain, spasm, and ischemia thought to be responsible for development of fissure in ano.
