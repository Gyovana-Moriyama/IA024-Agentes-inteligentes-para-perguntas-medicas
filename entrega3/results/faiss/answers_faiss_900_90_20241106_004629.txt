Venoocclusive disease can also affect hepatic outflow and has characteristic features on liver biopsy. Venoocclusive disease can be seen under the circumstances of conditioning for bone marrow transplant with radiation and chemotherapy; it can also be seen with the ingestion of certain herbal teas as well as pyrrolizidine alkaloids.

Treatment is based on management of the underlying cardiac disease.\n\nThe obstruction of two or more major hepatic veins produces liver enlargement, pain, and ascites, a condition known as Budd-Chiari syndrome. Obstruction of a single main hepatic vein by thrombosis is clinically silent. Hepatic damage is the consequence of increased intrahepatic blood pressure. Hepatic vein thrombosis is associated with the same hypercoagulable states as portal vein thrombosis as well as intraabdominal cancers, particularly HCC.

As in hypovolemic hyponatremia, the causative disorders can be separated by the effect on urine Na+ concentration, with acute or chronic renal failure uniquely associated with an increase in urine Na+ concentration (Fig. 63-5). The pathophysiology of hyponatremia in the sodium-avid edematous disorders (congestive heart failure [CHF], cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome) is similar to that in hypovolemic hyponatremia, except that arterial filling and circulatory integrity is decreased due to the specific etiologic factors (e.g., cardiac dysfunction in CHF, peripheral vasodilation in cirrhosis).

The urinalysis and urinary electrolyte measurements can be useful in distinguishing prerenal azotemia from ATN (Table 61-2). The urine Na and osmolality of patients with prerenal azotemia can be predicted from the stimulatory actions of norepinephrine, angiotensin II, ADH, and low tubule fluid flow rate. In prerenal conditions, the tubules are intact, leading to a concentrated urine (>500 mosmol), avid Na retention (urine Na concentration, <20 mmol/L; fractional excretion of Na, <1%), and UCr/PCr >40 (Table 61-2). The prerenal urine sediment is usually normal or has hyaline and granular casts, whereas the sediment of ATN usually is filled with cellular debris, tubular epithelial casts, and dark (muddy brown) granular casts.\n\nPoor cardiac output accompanied by decreased renal blood flow may cause prerenal azotemia and oliguria/anuria. Severe hypotension may produce acute tubular necrosis and acute renal failure. Prerenal azotemia is corrected when blood volume deficits are replaced or myocardial contractility is improved, but acute tubular necrosis does not improve immediately when shock is corrected. Prerenal azotemia is associated with a serum BUN-to-creatinine ratio of greater than 10:1 and a urine sodium level less than 20 mEq/L; acute tubular necrosis has a BUN-to-creatinine ratio of 10:1 or less and a urine sodium level between 40 and 60 mEq/L (see Chapter 165).

Prerenal azotemia and ATN are part of a spectrum of renal hypoperfusion; evidence of structural tubule injury is present in ATN, whereas prompt reversibility occurs with prerenal azotemia upon restoration of adequate renal perfusion.

In addition, paraneoplastic syndromes may mimic metastatic disease and, unless detected, lead to inappropriate palliative rather than curative treatment. Often the paraneoplastic syndrome may be relieved with successful treatment of the tumor. In some cases, the pathophysiology of the paraneoplastic syndrome is known, particularly when a hormone with biological activity is secreted by a tumor. However, in many cases, the pathophysiology is unknown. Systemic symptoms of anorexia, cachexia, weight loss (seen in 30% of patients), fever, and suppressed immunity are paraneoplastic syndromes of unknown etiology or at least not well defined. Weight loss greater than 10% of total body weight is considered a bad prognostic sign.\n\nParaneoplastic syndromes is the term used to refer to the disorders that accompany benign or malignant tumors but are not directly related to mass effects or invasion. Tumors of neuroendocrine origin, such as small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and carcinoids, produce a wide array of peptide hormones and are common causes of paraneoplastic syndromes. However, almost every type of tumor has the potential to produce hormones or to induce cytokine and immunologic responses. Careful studies of the prevalence of paraneoplastic syndromes indicate that they are more common than is generally appreciated. The signs, symptoms, and metabolic alterations associated with paraneoplastic disorders may be overlooked in the context of a malignancy and its treatment.

The options are glutamine, sodium, alanine, and leucine. \n\n- Sodium is typically involved in glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, particularly via the sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT).\n- Glutamine, alanine, and leucine are amino acids that can also be involved in renal metabolism but are less directly related to glucose transport.\n\nGiven that the drug decreases serum glucose levels and the urine glucose remains negative, it suggests that the drug likely inhibits sodium transport since sodium is crucial for glucose reabsorption.\n\nAction: search_docs\nAction Input: \"novel drug decreases serum glucose inhibits transporter proximal convoluted tubule sodium glucose\" \n", "type": "AgentAction"}}, "Glucose clearance Glucose at a normal plasma level (range 60\u2013120 mg/dL) is completely reabsorbed in proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) by Na+/glucose cotransport. In adults, at plasma glucose of \u223c 200 mg/dL, glucosuria begins (threshold). At rate of \u223c\u00a0375\u00a0mg/min, all transporters are fully saturated (Tm). Normal pregnancy is associated with \u008f\u00a0GFR. With \u008f\u00a0filtration of all substances, including glucose, the glucose threshold occurs at lower plasma glucose concentrations \u008e\u00a0glucosuria at normal plasma glucose levels. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (eg, -flozin drugs) result in glucosuria at plasma concentrations <\u00a0200 mg/dL.\n\nGlucosuria is an important clinical clue to diabetes mellitus.\n\nIn the normal individual, the proximal convoluted tubule reabsorbs almost all of the glucose filtered by the glomeruli. Ninety percent of the glucose reabsorption occurs through SGLT2 (Figure 15\u20132), but inhibiting this transporter using the currently available drugs will result in glucose excretion of only 30\u201350% of the amount filtered. Although we have known about the proximal tubule sodium/glucose cotransporter for many years, the inhibitors of this transport channel were developed only recently. Four SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ipragliflozin [available in Japan]) are currently available. Angiotensin II has been shown to induce SGLT2 production via the AT1 receptor. Thus, blockade of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone axis may result in lower SGLT2 availability.\n\n(Table 418-5) lower the blood glucose by selectively inhibiting this co-transporter, which is expressed almost exclusively in the proximal, convoluted tubule in the kidney. This inhibits glucose reabsorption, lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and leads to increased urinary glucose excretion. Thus, the glucose-lowering effect is insulin independent and not related to changes in insulin sensitivity or secretion. Because these agents are the newest class to treat type 2 DM (Table 418-5), clinical experience is limited. Due to the increased urinary glucose, urinary or vaginal infections are more common, and the diuretic effect can lead to reduced intravascular volume. As part of the FDA approval of canagliflozin in 2013, postmarketing studies for cardiovascular outcomes and for monitoring bladder and urinary cancer risk are under way."]]},"40": {"question": "A 24-year-old gravida 1 is admitted to the hospital after a tonic-clonic seizure at 37 weeks gestation.

During cold weather, a decrease in body temperature, especially in the extremities (lips, fingers, toes, and ears), shifts the O2 dissociation curve to the left (higher Hgb affinity). In this instance, PaO2 may be normal, but release of O2 in these extremities is not facilitated.\n\nHgb (Fig. 24.4 ). The S shape of the curve demonstrates the dependence of Hgb saturation on PO2, especially at partial pressures lower than 60 mm Hg. The clinical significance of the flat portion of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (>60 mm Hg) is that a drop in PO2 over a wide range of partial pressures (100 to 60 mm Hg) has a minimal effect on Hgb saturation, which remains at 90% to 100%, a level sufficient for normal O2 transport and delivery. The clinical significance of the steep portion (<60 mm Hg) of the curve is that a large amount of O2 is released from Hgb with only a small change in PO2, which facilitates the release and diffusion of O2 into tissue.

She says that she was walking home from work when she slipped on a patch of ice on the sidewalk. Since she did not have anything to hold onto, she fell backwards and landed on her posterior iliac crests bilaterally. Immediately after the fall, she started experiencing back pain and tenderness that concerned her enough to call for an ambulance. Her past medical history is significant for arthritis, diabetes, and hypertension. On arrival, her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 129/86 mmHg, pulse is 112/min, respirations are 19/min. Physical exam reveals tenderness to palpation over the middle of her lower back.

The patient's history of arthritis suggests she might be taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are known to inhibit prostaglandin production and can affect pain perception and inflammation. \n\nI will consider the options provided:\n- **A**: Inhibition of leukotriene and prostaglandin production - This mechanism could relate to certain anti-inflammatory medications, but it is less specific.\n- **B**: Inhibition of circulating cytokine - This is more related to immunosuppressive therapies and not directly linked to back pain from a fall.\n- **C**: Inhibition of folate processing - This is typically related to medications like methotrexate, which is not directly relevant to back pain from a fall.\n- **D**: Inhibition of prostaglandin production alone - This is a classic mechanism of NSAIDs, which are commonly used for arthritis and could predispose to pain after injury.\n\nGiven that back pain can be exacerbated by the inhibition of prostaglandins, which are crucial in mediating pain and inflammation, I will focus on options A and D, with a stronger inclination towards D due to its specificity.\n\nSince I need more information to confirm the most relevant mechanism, I will perform a search to gather more insights on the medications that could predispose this patient to her outcome.\n\nAction: search_docs  \nAction Input: 'drugs that predispose to back pain after fall mechanisms'  ", "type": "AgentAction"}}, "lower back are the most common loci. Weeks or months of unremitting daily tension-type headaches in the context of a normal examination are highly suggestive of depression at any age. If an exhaustive search for the source of the pain proves unsuccessful, the conclusion is finally reached that the pain is \u201cpsychogenic.\u201d This attribution of pain to some obscure psychologic mechanism is hardly helpful. Nevertheless, in a fair proportion of such patients, that pain will be alleviated by antidepressant drugs is suggestive of a linkage of the pain and depression. The problem may have been made even more difficult by repeated surgical operations as well as dependency on analgesic drugs, which in themselves deplete energy and have other adverse effects. Such patients are to be found among those disabled after multiple operations for ruptured intervertebral disc or arthritic hips or those with\n\nas well. Among the toxicities of these drugs, ataxia and other stability impairments lead to increased falls and fractures.\n\nMounting evidence of morbidities from long-term opioid therapy (including overdose, dependency, addiction, falls, fractures, accident risk, and sexual dysfunction) has prompted efforts to reduce use for chronic pain, including back pain (Chap. 18). Safety may be improved with automated reminders for high doses, early refills, or overlapping opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions. Greater access to alternative treatments for chronic pain, such as tailored exercise programs and cognitive-behavioral therapy, may also reduce opioid prescribing."]]},"placeholder": "placeholder"}]
