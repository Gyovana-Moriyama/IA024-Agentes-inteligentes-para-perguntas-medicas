It also mentions the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in back pain, particularly in the context of intervertebral disk injury.\n\nGiven that the question is about a drug that may have predisposed the patient to her back pain, and considering her history of arthritis, it is likely that the mechanism related to prostaglandin production is relevant. This leads me to focus on the options provided:\n\n- Option A: Inhibition of leukotriene and prostaglandin production\n- Option B: Inhibition of circulating cytokine\n- Option C: Inhibition of folate processing\n- Option D: Inhibition of prostaglandin production alone\n\nSince NSAIDs primarily work through the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, I will consider which option aligns most closely with this mechanism. \n\nAction: search_docs  \nAction Input: \"NSAID mechanism of action prostaglandin synthesis\"  ", "type": "AgentAction"}}, "NSAID anti-inflammatory activity is mediated chiefly through inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis (Figure 36\u20132).
