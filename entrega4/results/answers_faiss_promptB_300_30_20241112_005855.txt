The NM receptors (nicotinic receptors) are known to mediate fast synaptic transmission and are ionotropic, allowing for rapid signaling through the opening of Na+ and Ca2+ channels.

Delivery was complicated by postpartum hemorrhage requiring admission to the intensive care unit with blood transfusions. Pregnancy was otherwise uneventful, and the baby is healthy. The mother has had some difficulty with lactation, but is able to supplement her breast milk with formula feeds.
