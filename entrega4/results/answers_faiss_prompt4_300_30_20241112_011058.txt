Given the patient's symptoms of fatigue, cold intolerance, and dry skin, it is likely she is experiencing hypothyroidism. \n\nIn hypothyroidism, one would typically expect an increase in Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) as the body attempts to stimulate the thyroid gland, and possibly changes in other hormones. The options provided relate to different hormonal levels that could be affected in this context.\n\n- **A: Decreased prolactin** - Prolactin levels may not necessarily decrease in hypothyroidism.\n- **B: Decreased thyroid releasing hormone** - This is unlikely since hypothyroidism would typically lead to increased TRH due to low thyroid hormone levels.\n- **C: Increased follicle stimulating hormone** - This could occur in some cases but is not the primary expected change in hypothyroidism.\n- **D: Increased luteinizing hormone** - Similar to FSH, this is not the primary expected change.\n\nGiven the context of postpartum thyroid dysfunction, the most relevant lab abnormality would likely be an increase in TSH, which is not listed in the options. However, considering the options provided, the most logical choice in relation to the expected hormonal changes in postpartum hypothyroidism is likely to be related to changes in FSH or LH, which could be influenced by the overall endocrine status of the patient.\n\nSince no option directly correlates with hypothyroidism, I will analyze the options further based on common hormonal changes post-delivery and hypothyroid symptoms.\n\nAction: search_docs\nAction Input: \"postpartum thyroid dysfunction increased FSH LH prolactin\" ", "type": "AgentAction"}}, "387.\n\nThomas R, Reid RL.
