There are also rough, erythematous skin patches seen over her elbows which have been present for the last few months. She reports that herer father has a similar condition. They both use hydrating creams and topical glucocorticoids with moderate benefit.

She feels that the muscles in her shoulders and hips have been getting weaker and sometimes feel sore. She now has difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair.

The weakness is more pronounced with activities like climbing stairs and combing hair, which suggests a muscle-related issue. \\\\n3. The fact that the weakness improves after brief exercise is characteristic of myasthenia gravis, where muscle strength can temporarily improve after rest or brief exertion. \\\\n4. The presence of bladder incontinence is also notable; while not typical for myasthenia gravis, it can occur in cases with significant neuromuscular involvement or in conjunction with other conditions. \\\\n5. The anticholinesterase agent, which is used to treat myasthenia gravis, did not provide improvement, suggesting that the condition might be more complicated or that the diagnosis might be incorrect. However, the symptoms align closely with myasthenia gravis. \\\\n6. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is unlikely due to the patient's age and gender. \\\\n7. Hypothyroidism can cause weakness but is less likely to present with bladder incontinence and the specific pattern of muscle weakness described. \\\\n8.
